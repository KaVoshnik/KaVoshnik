### Hey there!

I’m Kirill, 19, a 4th-year college student. I’m currently working on two main projects:
- The frontend part of a private web application (my diploma project)
-  [MyOS](https://kavoshnik.github.io/) — my own operating system, built from scratch in C and x86 assembly

### My main tools: 
VS Code, Git, GitHub, GCC, NASM.  
I also use AI models to accelerate development and research.

### Fun Facts:
- I run a self-configured home server on Android TV
- I collect achievements everywhere — games, GitHub, life — especially if they have cool badges or icons
- I don’t drink alcohol or smoke. But I can easily drink 3 energy drinks per day
